This app uses apple's ARKit to place feature points in the scene to create 3d objects (specifically floor plans) that can be exported as .obj files by the user. The app uses the feature points determined by the user to make a to-scale representation of a simple 3D polygon. Adjustments to the base layer of the polygon can be made after placing the feature points in the "2D Floorplan" screen as seen. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.


Download the .obj file from the video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/132-11gMiBwov4iWTfZ3ab97p8j_pJnl7/view?usp=sharing)

## Future Improvements

- Implement a "take-back" button that unassignes the last feature point
- Implement a 3D view where the user can preview the .obj file before saving it
- Create a "snap to 90 degrees" feature in the adjusting screen
- Extend along normal to the base plane 

## Requirements

- Xcode 10.2.1
- iOS 10.2
